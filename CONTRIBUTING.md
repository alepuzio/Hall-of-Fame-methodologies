## ASK ONE NEW FUNCTIONALITY

 - Open a new issue, describing the problem or the new functionality. If it's possible, use the format _AS ... I WOULD ... TO OBTAIN..._
 - open a new local branch
 - Please follow the guidelines in [Google 's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) and in [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/3-4-rstudio.html): if you don't follow these guidelines, when you push your code and you request a _pull request_, I have one excuse to refuse your request
